levenshteingen
==============

This program generates the states for levenshtein automata for arbitary n. The alogorithm is implemented after Schulz and Mihov in Fast String Correction with Levenshtein-Automata. It's in a very early state and will most likely not improve very much over time. Take it as is.

To specify the max edit distance you have to edit the editDistance function in source code and compile again.
